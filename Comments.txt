30/4/2021 Friday:

Day of UI design.
I started with mobile view first and then desktop view.
I created design that had all elements in one page but it was too much for mobile view.
Switched to step by step view where you enter date, then location and finaly you get results
Then copied it to desktio view and finished it.

It is friday so that all for today. Tomorrow I will start with technical part where I will do research
about libraries and APIs.
