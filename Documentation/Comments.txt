30/04/2021 Friday:

Day of UI design.
I started with a mobile view first and then a desktop view.
I created a design with all elements on one page, but it was too much for mobile view.
Switched to step by step view where you enter a date, then location, and finally get results.
Then copied it to desktop view and finished it.

It is Friday, so that all for today. Tomorrow I will start with the technical part, where 
I will research libraries and APIs.

I started with writing HTML. The main problem was making the whole page fluid, but I got it working.
User input validation was a hassle. The main things that I have copied from StackOverflow are 
time-related answers because why reinvent the wheel + I don't trust myself with time objects. 
Too many corner cases. I started with the map, but it was getting late.

I made some pancakes and continued with the map. I finally got it working after troubleshooting 
a weird bug where the map gets corrupted, but if you resize the window, it was fine again. After 
that, I started implementing API 
for data requests. Then multiple API requests for a date range, but that was getting quite heavy. 
After that started looking for a graph to display date range data. There were a lot of 
problems, but I finally got it working.
